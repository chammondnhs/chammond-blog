# Easy
Shoot spinner. Thats it.

# Medium
(preferred strat) alley pass from left to right to go over inlane. This lights spinner. Rip spinner.

# Hard
Spell alien. This qualifies multiball at scoop - dont collet on 2x hit spinner to change. Once in multiball - do medium strat of inlane alley pass to spinner.

# General notes
