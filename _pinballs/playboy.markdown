# Easy
Shoot the bunnies. Each bunny increases bonus, hitting all bunnies increases bonus multiplier. If you complete bunny set, the left scoop qualifies for 25K 3 times. Thats the goal, finish bunnies and hit in that scoop. The scoop also increases bonus by number of bunnies qualified. If close to 20 bonus, it can be beneficial to hold off increasing multiplier to hit scope and get to 20 bonus, which will carry.

Scope can be shot by right orbit into it. Or from right flipper up into the hole directly. EB loop is almost a guaranteed drain.

# Medium
# Hard
# General notes
Skill shot â€“ plunge into bunny 1, and nudge machine to get into scope.
