# Easy
Go for the multiball. Shoot left drop target, then scope, then left target for multiball. During multiball, try to shoot drop targets. Be careful, this carries from player to player so it can be stolen.

# Medium
Go for spinners. Shoot all 6 drop targets on right to increase spinner to 3k. Then let the spinner rip. You can hit 6 drop targets again to increase to 4k, but its not worth it unless its only a shot away. If you do get to 4k, then bringing in a multiball can make scoring insane. Each spinner rip is 2x 4k, 8k per rip. A good rip is 10-20 spins.
