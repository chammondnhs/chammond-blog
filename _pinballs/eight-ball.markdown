# Easy
The goal is to get 8ball. Get 3 or 4 balls to build up bonus, then shoot the right orbit. It increases bonus to 2x, 3x, 5x and then rewards points. 

# Medium
Left spinner is always good if spinner in good condition. When spinner is lit its worth a fair amount. Getting all 4 inlanes in the top lights the middle inlane which when rolled over, increases orbit which increases bonus. So, I like to just do lit spinner rips (10-20k a shot) rather than bonus (3k/ball)

# Hard
# General notes

Skill shot - If you can plunge to go in hole 4, it will normally bounce and hit the 8 ball target which helps with drains.

Hint - Hitting the 8ball target lights the left outlane save.
