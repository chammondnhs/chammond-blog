# Easy
Light dinosaur, then catch it. This lights control room, shoot the C shot and choose the far right option (system boot). Shoot the spinner and combo into upper loop or tower for ~30M points. T-rex multiball through hitting the truck 3 times is a nice addition.

# Medium
Light dinosaur, then catch it. Shoot all of the blue drop targets to light the supply drop, collecting supply drop lights 2x scoring. Enable 2x scoring on the control room and choose system boot. Shoot the spinner and combo into upper loop or tower for ~30M x2.

# Hard
I own this table, are you ready? Even if you do half of this you will have 300M+ - this will let you break the billion mark before hitting visitor center.

1/ Light dinosaur on the left. Start the paddock.
2/ Hit t-rex to bring multiball into first paddock. We dont care about multiball. Catch the dinos then do the standup targets. If you finished that then go for perfect paddock rescues before playing multiball - its not worth much even if you build it up or super.
3/ You have a supply drop lit. Hit spinner and hold upper right flipper to light 2x. Shoot control room and choose system boot.
4/ Bring 2x into system boot. Start with spinner combo as thats worth the most. H-O is the easiest way to finish the mode. If you complete this mode, and did the spinner-truck combo at some point - thats a free 60M points.
5/ Lock ball in raptor backhanding. Get it down to 2%.
6/ Hit t-rex to start chase. Bring raptor multiball into chase.
7/ Play another control room. Restore power. Shoot spinner. This mode can be woth a lot - but its worth even more if you just straight up finish it. If you finish the mode - do H-C combo for ~100M fossil bonus.

# General notes
Skill shot – Full plunge, shoot the H – A – Tower – O. You can also do H – A – Loop – Tower.
