# Easy
Do the skill shot and get it in top collect. If you get the skill shot 5k on each 5 balls - thats 25k which will beat most people.

# Medium
The trick is to hit the middle target in the bottom of the playfield. That collects tunnel and raises the middle to protect the ball. You want to hit this pretty dead-on but not too strong. I like to let the ball rest against the post, tap pass into cradle then make the shot from cradle. If you get setup, you can repeat this a handful of times for big money.

If the tunnel is 3k or less, its not worth it. Backhand the left target from the left side to raise tunnel (and maybe bounce into tunnel reset). Then try to lock in a higher value.

# Hard
# General notes
Skill shot - plunge your shot so the tunnel locks into 5k. Its normally at around 2k when to do a plunge.
