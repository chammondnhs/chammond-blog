# Easy
Shoot the spinner shot, try to get it into the scope, which will kick it back out. After bonus gets up to 10k, I go for flag 3 (bottom flag on left). If you get flag 3, then collect as rollover it doubles bonus.

# Hard
# General notes
Be careful of the feed. You may need to let dead bounce, live catch, or hold up left flipper for safety.

tap pass or alley pass for spinner. Alley is safer, but can be tricky depending on machine.
