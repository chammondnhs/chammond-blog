Shoot the scope 2 times, which will make next shot start a mode. Shoot center ramp (4 times depending on setting) which will make next shot start multiball. Shoot scope to start mode, then shoot center to start multiball. As soon as you hit the center and know it will qualify multiball, hold down the action button. This takes ~3s but will “light shots on fire” which enables bonus scoring on shots. If you are still going, just shoot the center ramp over and over. You will play razorcrest hurry up which isn’t worth much, but then it will light another multiball. Shoot scope to start a mode, and then play the multiball. You should have a foundry purchase which you will buy the light shots on fire. Repeat the exact same as start of game, play razorcrest with shots on fire in the mode.

Shooting the targets on the right increases your playfield multiplier. Risky shots but beneficial in multiball.
# Hard
# General notes
Skill shot – half plunge into child
Skill shot - full plunge when rollover is moving from left to right over the i/l so its light on c when ball goes by
