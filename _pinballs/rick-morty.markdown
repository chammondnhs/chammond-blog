# Easy
Hit the post between the u-turn and the right ramp. This qualifies a lock, then lock a ball in the u-turn. After 2 locks you get a multiball at the scoop.

# Medium
Setup a multiball and an adventure together.

# Hard
# General notes
Skill shot - Its lit on the playfield. I like doing the upper loop (spinner), because if you combo it - it increases the skill shot value.
