# Easy
Shoot the center target over and over. The first 4 times (dependent on settings) gives you multiball. The next 4 gives you hurry up.

# Medium
Pick prime directive. Play the modes if you can by shooting lit shots, but not too important. Play vengeance multiball in one mode. Shooting green target at end of the upper flipper lights locks. Play multiballs in modes and try to finish modes. Vengence multiball is worth 10k when you finish, and victory laps are worth a lot especially if in a mode. Mash the center button if its lit to finish off vengeance.
