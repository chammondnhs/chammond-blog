# Easy
The goal is to get it in the two outer lanes in the upper playfield, this doubles bonus. Then hit the lit rollovers. Hold the upper flipper rather than flip, a flip will send to outlane, but holding it will drop on upper flipper. Be careful of hole on flipper.

# Medium
# Hard
One you max bonus and have 2x - drop targets are worth $$ per completion
