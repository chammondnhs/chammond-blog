# Easy
Shoot the right spinner. This will send ball into upper playfield. Your goal is to light the 3 lanes. They can be relit for additional points.

# Medium
Do easy, but hit a drop target on the left side of the playfield. This will “open the gate” and let you have a skillshot on start of next ball into scope by bouncing off of wall. This skillshot is worth the number of rows you have completed. Once you build up bonus the inlane drop targets increase bonus multiplier - so risky but big payout.
