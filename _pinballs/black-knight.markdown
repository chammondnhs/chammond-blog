# Easy
Shoot drop targets. You only get points if all 3 go down on the same bank, but you get extra for doing the same bank multiple times.

# Medium
Go for multiball. Soft plunge the ball and hold right flipper so the ball lightly bounces to left upper flipper, then lock. Do this 3 times for multiball. If the ball enters lower playfield, hit scoop in center to start multiball. Multiball is a multiplier, so 3 balls in play grants 3x that drop, which can be worth a lot with repeated hits. After building 10-15K bonus, shoot the left figure 8 to increase bonus to 2x/3x/5x. The figure 8 can be risky, so safer to do in multiball, but can be worth it to drain if there is a large bonus built. Shot is easiest on a backhand if the flippers are strong enough, if they are weaker you have to use the right flipper though.

# Hard
# General notes
Note - if "hard mode" is on - you have to go through the 2x figure 8 to lock a ball
