# Easy
Shoot inline drop targets on the right. This increases your bonus.

# Medium
Shoot drop targets on the left. After bank completion the spinner is lit. Shoot spinner.

# Hard
Bonus is good with inlane drops and drop targets on the left. But, you want the upper playfield drops timed with the 123. This will increase playfield multiplier. Playfield multiplier plus spinner seems to be the points.

# General notes
Preferred strat - Go for drop targets on the left until they are completed. Alley pass to get ball on right flipper and complete them. The inlane drops are too risky if you dont have bonus built. Once you have bonus built to 5-10k then if ball is on left flipper do inlane drops on right and if ball is on right flipper do spinner.

Note - if you get all of the dots then your end of ball gets a bonus 100k? Hard to qualify, but if you are one or two shots away its worth it. You can qualify with strong alley passes.
