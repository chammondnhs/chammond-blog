# Easy
Saucers. Shoot the middle over and over.  You need to hit all 3 targets to drop the gate, but the middle spots other targets. Damage the saucer by hitting in the middle, hitting all targets deals more damage. Hit these targets angled so the ball does not come straight back down.

# Medium
Try to bring a mulltiball in and during the multiball destroy a saucer. I like to do the first saucer in solo play. Then if you hit all of the aliens you light mars, hitting all aliens again gives multiball. Shoot ramp to the left of the saucer to light locks, then lock balls for another multiball. The alien multiball can be risky as a weak shot to that ramp will commonly end the ball with a drain. The big multiball that is worth the most points is shooting each orbit/lane 3 times. After the final one, it immediately starts TNA.

# Hard
# General notes
Skill shot â€“ hold left flipper whichever shot you make grants multiple hits to that shot. Helps start a saucer or TNA faster.

TNA - If you shoot all shots to fully light them (~5 times) you start total nuclear annihilation. This can be a high scoring multiball if you have good ball control during multiball.
