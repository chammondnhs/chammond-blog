# Easy
(preferred strat) Shoot orbit spinners.

# Medium
Shoot orbit spinners until they are maxed. Then complete a set of drops to 2x your bonus. You can complete multiple sets of drops to increase bonus too.

# Hard
# General notes
The lit orbit for bonus collect changes every ball.
The scoop to the side of the orbit collects but resets that spinner.

DO NOT drop catch/cradle. There is no inlane so you will die.
