# Easy
Shoot the lit shot, pretty straightforward. Focus on controlled shots to lit shot on the lower playfield. It helps to do it from top to bottom or bottom to top to minimize risk of knocking down multiple targets. Hitting all targets resets them.

# General notes
Skill shot - if you are lucky/smart you end a ball so a full plunge goes over the 5k rollover
