# Easy
Get the ball through B which will light spinner. Let spinner rip over and over. This is my preferred strat as a good spinner is 10-20k, which is roughly the same as a 2x scoop after a strike.

# Medium
Shoot right ramp. Your goal is to spell ABC for 2x bonus, and get it in the scope. If you get 2x bonus, then each scoop is with 6k.

If you get lucky and clear the playfield (get a strike) it increases the value of the scoop. But the rollovers are risky to target.
