# Easy
Shoot the center target to start doodling. Then keep the ball alive.

# Medium
Spell 1-2-3-4 to build doodle value and then doodle. This is where the big money can be, but 2/3 shots are risky.

# Hard
# General notes
Fuck this game. I generally like most pinball machines - even ones I dont like. But this game can be deleted from history and no one will care.
