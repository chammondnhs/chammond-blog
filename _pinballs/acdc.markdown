# Easy
Pick mode with ramps. Shoot both ramps over and over. You will get 2 or 3 multiballs.

# Medium
Start with ramp mode. Your goal is to re-light the inlanes. If song swaps, TNT is next easiest especially if they are targets and not drops.

# Hard
# General notes
I always forget this machine. Something like completing 4 sets of inlanes lights a super jackpot at the cannon - which is huge scoring.
