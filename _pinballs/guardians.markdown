# Easy
Shoot up the middle over and over, this will start groot multiball. It helps to pick a mode like nebula (blue) or gamora (green) as they are big modes. Bonus if you can shoot it into the scope.

# Medium
Play xandor (light blue). When you light locks it will shoot into pops awarding shots. We donâ€™t care about the mode (now). Light 2 locks, then timeout the mode. Start nebula (blue) by shooting in scoop. Then shoot groot to start multiball, and then shoot into scope to powerup nebula. A decent multiball here is worth 100M. If you light hadron (action button), use it when modes are stacked. If you are still going, play starlord which will give you a multiball. Then play sanctuary and finish xandor. This will light cherry bomb mode.
