# Easy
Go for map. Shoot the left ramp 3 times which will spell map, then shoot the map. This grants 25K+ and gives some nice rewards, including a multiball which can be big scoring. During multiball, keep shooting map shot or mystery shot to collect bonus.

# Medium
Collect diamonds to qualify locks, then lock ball. Shoot the diamond shots to get diamonds, then the left orbit to lock a ball. During multiball, shoot the left ramp over and over. Hitting into mystery will grant a diamond multiball to help get some, and hitting map will relight diamonds helping get more. You can also shoot left orbit to qualify AMY, if you beat AMY she grants a lot of points and diamonds.

# Hard
# General notes
Skill shot – Plunge into the left outlane which will kickback

Hint – Do not play satellite mode. If you are hitting satellites and qualify the mode, it disables everything except that shot. Its not worth it, the mode will kill you for no points, so time it out.

Hint – If you shoot the turnaround to the right of the left ramp, this will qualify gorilla underneath. But, more importantly it will send ball to upper left flipper, flip and combo an upper loop for 5-15M points. Repeating this can be lucrative, especially when added to the gorilla reward.
