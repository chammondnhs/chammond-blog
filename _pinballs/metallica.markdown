# Easy
Shoot sparky. It will give you a multiball, play it over and over.

# Medium
(preferred) During sparky multiball, try to hit the snake and the coffin. This will let you get all 3 on a lit shot, then collect it, which locks it in. Your goal is to collect enough of all of them to light crank it up. Play crank it up and choose battery, then hit sparky over and over.

# Hard
# General notes
Worth a shout out - hitting coffin enough times grants a multiball. It is safest to backhand.
