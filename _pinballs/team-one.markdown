# Easy
I go for center ramp which lights scope, then hit scope. Repeat over and over. This will clear the mansion which is worth a lot.

# Medium
If you can light all numbers, that’s worth a lot. It will make each lit target worth 50k instead of 1k. But, risky to go for, so I don’t go for it, but if I get lucky then I swap playstyle to go for those targets.

# Hard
# General notes
Count your wows. I've been screwed by this game 3 times now - I really need to count outloud.
