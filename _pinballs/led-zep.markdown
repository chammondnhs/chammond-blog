# Easy
Shoot the Zepellin target 3 times. Easiest from a cradled backhand. This starts multiball. Right targets will relight.

# Medium
Before doing Zepellin multiball, shoot into the scope to start a mode. I prefer the pops mode. Use Zepellin to hit into pops and finish the mode. Once zepellin ends, the mode is qualified and shoot into scope to start. The mode is collecting switch hits, the best two are the spinner and pops, which are both hit from backhanding the spinner shot sending into pops. Also try to spell LED ZEP, and ROCK if you can in this mode. LED ZEP will be another multiball when this ends and ROCK relights zepellin. Green button spots icarus, after a few icarus targets (center target just to right of center ramp), it spots add a ball.

Chain those multiballs. Use ZEP to qualify tour to qualify electric to qualify tour.

# Hard
Combos that end at a drop target build that drop target. After completing all 4 drop targets it lights icarus (must be hit) for playfield multiplier. Timing this with a multiball can be beneficial.
