# Easy
Shoot up the middle which will raise ball to upper play field. Toggle between the lower and upper shots (whichever is lit). This is the safest way to play.

# Medium
Qualify locks by hitting targets on either side of middle shot, then shooting middle shot.

# Hard
# General notes
The game has a lot of kill you shots, so be careful on a fast/aggro machine.

Rafts can be worth a reasonable amount after you have collected a bunch. I like to go for the raft if its on a safe shot.
