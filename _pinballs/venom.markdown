# Easy
Start the first guy to qualify two locks. Your goal is to put both locks on the right side. Skip the multi-ball prompt when it pops up, you want a 3 ball multiball for the playfield multiplier. Perform a combo (which you probably already qualified) for the third lock. Have fun with the multiball with a playfield multiplier. All 3 locks need to be on the right side!

# Medium
Start the second guy to get the sleeper achievement. Your goal is to fill out the middle chart to get the 1x playfield multiplier, while simultaneously locking balls on the right to stack another 1x playfield multiplier. The chart will have have a dot like yellow, blue, white. Shoot that shot and then combo the same. White shot then white shot fills the white. Once you finish all three change characters to finish the 1x playfield. If you drain, only swap characters if you have the bottom two filled out and will get the 1x playfield. Lock balls on the right scoop but skip mult-ball. Keep skipping multiball until you have the 1x on the middle chart and 1x with ball 3 locked on the right (normally 4th lock).

# General notes
You pretty much want to backhand every single shot. Control the ball, post pass, backhand. Although the combos do normally require a backhand then forehand shot.
