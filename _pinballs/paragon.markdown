# Easy
Shoot the spinner. The spinner builds bonus and a good rip will grant 5k.

# Medium
Shoot the left drop targets. These build bonus and give bonus multiplier. After getting to 3 or 5x, start shooting spinner. 5x bonus and a 5k spinner is worth 25k! The easiest way is to cradle on left flipper, tap pass to right and then hit the target/spinner.

(preferred) Alternatively, you can get one or two spinner rips in to build up bonus before going for the multiplier.

# Hard
Shoot the spinner to lock in 20K bonus. The bonus continues for each ball, then go for the drop targets. Getting to 5x grants 5k bonus, so then one good spinner hit will give another 5k increasing the bonus to 30K. Repeat.

# General notes
tap pass, tap pass, tap pass
