# Easy
Shoot left ramp to light lock, the shoot left orbit to lock. This gives a multiball where you are trying to shoot left and right ramps. After this is done, shoot the crate a bunch of times for another multiball, where you continue to shoot crate.

# Medium
(preferred strat) Get the coffin on the wheel before doing coffin multiball, and get the crate on the wheel before doing crate multiball. This grants an extra ball save timer and restarts the multiball.

# Hard
Before doing coffin multiball, spin the wheel and do the pot of gold. This will give you a 2x multiplier during the multiball.

# General notes
Skill shot â€“ Plunge into the scoop to spin the wheel. Stop on crate or coffin to spot those.
