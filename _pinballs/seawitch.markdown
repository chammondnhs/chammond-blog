# Easy
Shoot drop targets - thats where your points are at.

# Medium
(preferred) Shoot the lit drop targets. Center bank, then left lower bank, then upper right bank. The targets increase bonus, and doing the lit bank increases the bonus multiplier. Repeated clearing of the same bank grants additional benefits as well.
