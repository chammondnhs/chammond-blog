# Easy
Shoot the center target to kill the castle. Repeat.

# Medium
Shoot a shot 3 times to light a multiball. Use multiball to destroy castle. Shoot the hole to left of castle for multiball. Use multiball to destroy castle.

If you shoot the same shot a number of times it qualifies a multi-ball at the scoop. Bringing in 2 or 3 of these can be worth a lot of points. I find trolls safe and relatively easy (standups next to castle gates).
# Hard
# General notes
Skill shot â€“ Hold left flipper, shoot any shot which will complete that shot for multiball.
