# Easy
Shoot the drop targets on the center right. Thatâ€™s it. It gives points and increases bonus and is relatively safe.

# Medium
Hitting a pop bumper changes the drop targets from giving points to increasing multiplier. Once the points are built up (10-20K) start trying to increase multiplier instead of just doing banks.

# Hard
# General notes
Be really careful ally passing as the ball likes to pop out of the inlane and go to the outlane
