# Easy
Light one racer. Send to upper playfield. DO NOT COLLECT racer, instead bonzai run. This increases in value and maintains over balls. This gets pretty large 250K? cap.

# Medium
Same as Easy, but after the reward gets to 100K start spelling ABC in upper playfield. This doubles the bonus.

Alternatively â€“ Anytime ball enters left flipper, combo onto right ramp. This gives a lap. Laps are worth bonus points every ball. If you stack laps, bonus can get quite large.
