# Easy
Shoot the light lock, then hit into the scoop. Do this 3 times for a  multiball.

Shoot center ramp (twice) and then in scoop to start a mode.

# Medium
Bring the multiball into a mode. Start the mode by shooting the center flail and then center ramp then getting into scoop. You can start these at the same time. Best modes are lich (light blue), sand worm (yellow), and hydra (green). You can shoot the spinner to change modes, but I donâ€™t find it worth it unless you are on the hand (red).
