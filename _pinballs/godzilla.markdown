# Easy
Shoot right ramp over and over. This will damage building and allow locks, put in locks and play the multiball. Doing skill shots on the locks can be worth a lot. During multiball, the goal is to shoot the same shot over and over until it unlights, then shoot tower to collect.

# Medium
Shoot left and right ramps, then shoot in the scoop to start a mode. Start titan mode and bring in multiball from easy.

# Hard
Get to the tier 2 mode by playing first battle, then changing cities. Play second monster. Ebera and Titan are the easiest modes, but gigan is the easiest mode just shooting right ramp over and over. Play ghidora in tier 2, make sure you have Godzilla powerup 3 for extra time on tier2 mode. Shoot any shot 3 times, try to complete 2 or 3 then shoot it into the scoop. Repeat 3 times, then leave. A bad score here is 150M, relatively easy to get 250-500M.

# General notes
Skill shot â€“ Do all skill shots to increase multiplier. First rollover only (250K). Pop (500K). Spinner (5M). Spinner combo to scope (10M). Right inline (5M). Start with easy skill shot to increase multiplier on first ball, then go for spinner on second/third ball. You get an extra skill shot during multiball if you qualify locks, which can be very lucrative.

Preferred strat is to start with easy. Because a decent multiball with extra skill shots can beat most people. The modes are easier and worth more in single ball play. Then go for hard tier-2 mode for the big payout.
