# Easy
Shoot center. Hit it over and over and it will give you a multiball. Anytime the scope is lit, shoot it for 500K (competition mode).

# Medium
Shoot Quora loop, combo into loop, then combo into scope. Completing this combo is worth ~1.5M and grows each time. It also qualifies quora multiball. Repeat.

# Hard
# General notes
Skill shot â€“ soft plunge and nudge machine up to have ball hit scoop
