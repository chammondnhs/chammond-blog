# Easy
Shoot the scoop to start a mode.
Shoot mini deadpool for a multiball.

# Medium
Shoot the center spinner to qualify double damage on mode. Shoot scoop to start a mode and play juggernut. Shoot mini deadpool for multiball. Destroy him!

Save your booms. When you play your next mode if you have less than 2 booms - go wolverine. Shoot spinners to kill quickly. If you have booms go mistique and shoot lit shot or boom to make the shoot easier.

# Hard
# General notes
There is a little target next to center spinner. If you hit it and it bounces up - you get a playfield multiplier. Or if you hit it and then immediately shoot katana you get playfield multiplier.
