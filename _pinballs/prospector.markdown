# Easy
Only two goals in this game.
1/ Go for gold. Shoot the left loop, which has a rollover to increment gold. Each gold is worth 10K. If you can hit targets 5 and 6, that doubles gold bonus.
2/ Go for spinners. Just keep shooting them. They build value and eventually start giving 1k per spin. If they’re spinning hot, it can be worth it to only shoot the lit spinner.

I shoot gold from right and spinner from left.
# Medium
# Hard
# General notes
Skill shot – target the lit rollover to hit the gold target (10k)

If you are great at alley passing and the flippers are strong, you can alley pass hard enough to flip the 5 and 6 on inlanes to double bonus
