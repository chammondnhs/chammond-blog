# Easy
Score goals. When the goalie is moving, the goal is open and shooting it scores a goal. If you shoot to the right of the goalie it lights a special mode, keep playing those modes. The TV will light, shoot that and play it.

# Medium
 Shoot ramps to build speed, stamina and then ball lock. Shoot scope to start final draw multiball. Score goals for insane scoring during multiball.
 
# Hard
