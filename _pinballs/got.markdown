# Easy
Pick stark. When you shoot a shot 3 times you qualify a mode, play a mode. If you are draining press your action button which will finish the mode and grant you some points (stark bonus). Not worth lots of points - but can be some cheesy easy points.

# Medium
Choose lanister. Shoot the right target to light lock, easier by hitting left target and letting it bounce. Lock 2 balls and have the last lit. Then shoot the left orbit 3 times to light grayjoy and battle. Shoot loop, then play lanister grayjoy in blackwater. If the red button is flashing press it, it will give you a 2x multiplier as lanister.
