Have you ever played Pinball? If not, go try it for less than a dollar, its loads of fun for lots of people. Not everyone will love it, and that’s okay, but if you have never tried you might just find yourself hooked. If you like games, physics, electronics, or art, you just might like Pinball. It’s a unique blend of a game, which on average lasts no more than 5 minutes, with interesting physics, lots of electronics, and awesome stories. When you play, you travel through a new story with each new ball. Some are themed after movies and music, while others have their own unique story, and believe it or not, some are themed after pinball itself! I have the pleasure of living in CO with some of the world’s best pinballers, in fact I have played many games with the world’s best, Escher.

I have two new modern Stern pinball machines made by Keith Elwin - Jurassic Park and Godzilla. Notice a theme? I am slowly building out a little arcade in my basement. Pinball is great because the games are relatively short and there is no progress. I like video games too, but I do not get too much time to play - so its difficult to remember what you were doing and why. With pinball, every game starts from the begining and is an adventure that only lasts a few minutes.
