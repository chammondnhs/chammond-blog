Opportunity cost is something many people in the finance world recognize, but few consider it in software engineering. It is what you give up (potential) when choosing one option over another. Presented with two options, option 1 hold cash and option 2 invest in stocks. If I choose option 1, then the 6% interest is the opportunity cost. The notable tradeoff in investing is commonly risk, as holding cash is much less risky then investing in stocks. In software, the same thing happens. We can go with option A or option B, they both have strengths and weaknesses. If I choose A, then I donâ€™t get B. However, a more common scenario that I see newer managers make is doing both A and B. The logic seems sound, we do not know which one will be better until progress is made on both. But, what are we sacrificing? We are sacrificing completing either A or B and moving on to the next project C. Most projects grow exponentially, so if C builds upon either A or B, the opportunity cost can be huge.
