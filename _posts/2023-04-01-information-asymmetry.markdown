Information asymmetry is difficult to deal with. In the finance world, information asymmetry leads to unnatural profits. If you know a company is going bankrupt, short and profit. You know a company has a big win coming up, leverage up and profit. Surprisingly enough, this same asymmetry is a critical part of any job. What does your manager know that you don’t? What does your managers manager know that your manager doesn’t? It is safe to assume that others around you know more than you do, so be careful how you handle that next situation. You can go collect more information to make a better informed decision, or you can take the information provided and make the best decision you can at that moment in time. I personally like to make sure that all of the key stakeholders for large decisions all have the same information. Sometimes, people will still disagree, but more often than not, disagreements arise from information asymmetry. Knowledge is power, go use this the next time you are resolving a disagreement.
