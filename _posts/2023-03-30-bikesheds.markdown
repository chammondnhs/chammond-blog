The false alure of engineering decisions. A disproportionate amount of time is spent debating (arguing) over “engineering decisions”. Based upon my experiences, most of them don’t matter. There will be 5 to 10 people on a call for an hour or two debating about whether to write in Java or Typescript. Congrats, you just wasted a dev week. Some are more challenging, like compute on lambda or fargate. But does compute choice matter? Sure, in certain scenarios it does, but 90% of the time it does not matter. When we have a group of people debating over something trivial and easily changeable, let me ask you, how much time was spent debating that product or feature? How much customer value will it deliver? How much revenue will it make? When you factor in engineering effort, release process, and the cost to run it – will the feature be profitable? Or, did you spend more time debating trivial items rather than focusing on the bigger picture?
